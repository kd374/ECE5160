									<h2>LAB 1A - Artemis Setup</h2>
								</header>
						
								<!-- Introduction -->
								<section class="content-section">
									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>The aim of this lab to set up Sparkfun Artemis board, which is going to be used for the rest of the semester and be the crucial aspect of communication between robots.</p>
								</section>
						
								<!-- Virtual Environment Setup -->
								<section class="content-section">
									<h3>Prelab 1A: Installation of Arduino IDE </h3>
									<p>The first step of the Prelab 1A was to install the latest versions of Arduino IDE (version 2.3.4) and Sparkfun Apollo3 boards manager. Furthermore, I was able to successfully install all the required libraries for the prelab and thus perform the proposed tasks below. </p>

									<h3>Lab 1A </h3>
									<h4>Task 1: Blink</h4>
									<p>The example Blink code was run in order to confirm that we are able to program simple code onto the Artemis board.</p>

								<section class="content-section">
									<h4>Task 2: Serial</h3>
									<p>This task was implemented in order to test for the UART communication between the computer and the board. Considering that I experienced issues with my Serial Monitor due to which my laptop restarted, I set the baud rate to 9600 instead of 115200 which was successful.</p>

								<section class="content-section">
									<h4>Task 3: Analog Read</h3>
									<p>This task was performed by utilizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which is an integrated device which converts analog voltage to a digital signal. AnalogRead() function thus enables reading out the temperature data from the sensor. The temperature recorded was about 33400 counts, however, once the chip was held, the temperature would slightly increase. Therefore, the temperature sensor was able to successfully detect the changes. </p>

									<h4>Task 4: Microphone Output</h3>
									<p>This task taught us how to use the microphone integrated onto the Artemis board. This is performed through using the PDM or pulse-density-modulation code provided. The first image demonstrates the frequency while there was no to little sound detected. However, the second image demonstrates the frequencies captured while talking. Hence, the microphone sensor was able to distingues between loud and quiet sounds successfully.</p>

									<h4>Additional task for ECE 5160: "C" note detector  </h3>
									<p>This task taught us how to program a "C" note detector by manipulating on-board LED switching into the Microphone_Output code.</p>

									<h3>Discussion and Reflection</h3>
									<p>The performed tasks were very insightful and helpful in teaching us how to navigate the Arduino IDE environment, and with the "C" speaker assignment, practice playing with the provided code to create new functionalities. </p>

								<h2>LAB 1B - Bluetooth Communication</h2>
							</header>
						
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>This section of the lab focuses on establishing a Bluetooth connection between the Artemis board and the computer. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was used for wireless communication, allowing data transfer between devices.</p>
						</section>
						
						<section class="content-section">
							<h3>Prelab 1B: Installing Bluetooth Libraries</h3>
							<p>Before implementing Bluetooth communication, the necessary libraries were installed, including ArduinoBLE. These libraries allow the Artemis board to act as a BLE peripheral, enabling it to send and receive data wirelessly.</p>
						</section>
						
						<section class="content-section">
							<title>Lab 1B Tasks</h3>
						
							<h4>Task 1: Connecting to Artemis via BLE</h4>
							<p>The Artemis board was configured to advertise itself as a BLE peripheral, and a Python script was used to connect to the board and exchange messages.</p>
						
							<!-- Example Image -->

						</section>
						
						<section class="content-section">
							<h4>Task 2: Sending and Receiving Data</h4>
							<p>Once connected, BLE was used to transmit and receive messages between the Artemis board and the computer. This was achieved using BLE characteristics for sending data packets.</p>

							<h3>Discussion and Reflection</h3>
							<p>Lab 1B provided a hands-on experience in working with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and understanding its role in wireless communication. The lab was instrumental in setting up Artemis for future remote-controlled experiments.</p>
