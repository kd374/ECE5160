Furthermore, I was able to successfully install all the required libraries for the prelab and thus perform the proposed tasks below. </p>

                                <p>This task was implemented in order to test for the UART communication between the computer and the board. Considering that I experienced issues with my Serial Monitor due to which my laptop restarted, I set the baud rate to 9600 instead of 115200 which was successful.</p>

                                <p>This task was performed by utilizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which is an integrated device which converts analog voltage to a digital signal. AnalogRead() function thus enables reading out the temperature data from the sensor. The temperature recorded was about 33400 counts, however, once the chip was held, the temperature would slightly increase. Therefore, the temperature sensor was able to successfully detect the changes. </p>

                                <p>This task taught us how to use the microphone integrated onto the Artemis board. This is performed through using the PDM or pulse-density-modulation code provided. The first image demonstrates the frequency while there was no to little sound detected. However, the second image demonstrates the frequencies captured while talking. Hence, the microphone sensor was able to distingues between loud and quiet sounds successfully.</p>

                                <h4>Additional task for 5000-level students: "C" note detector  </h3>
                                <p>This task taught us how to program a "C" note detector by manipulating on-board LED switching into the Microphone_Output code. The way I implemented the task is by detecting the frequency that is 523 HZ +/- 10 Hz to introduce some error, and in case the freqency detected is in-between the desired range for not "C5", then the LED turns on (blue light) as can be seen in the recorded video. For other frequencies, the LED turns off.</p>
