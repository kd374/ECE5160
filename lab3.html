                                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                                <p>The aim of this lab was to integrate Time of Flight (ToF) sensors which will be crucial in the ultimate functionality of the car by accurately detecting the surrounding objects.</p>

                            <!-- Virtual Environment Setup -->
                            <section class="content-section">
                                <h3>Prelab 3: </h3>
                                <p>The fundamental step of the prelab was to determine the wiring of the two ToF sensors, as well as how they would integrate with the IMU used in the previous lab. By reading through the datasheet, it was determined that the <code> blue connection indicated on the diagram below represents SDA, and the labeled yellow connection represents SCL.</code> The proposed sensors communicate through I2C, including the IMU from the previous lab, thus the QWIIC breakout board ought to be used establishing the connection among all sensors. The weires connecting from the QWIIC connector are further stripped and soldered onto the two ToF sensors.</p>
                                <code> insert the picture</code>
                                <p> Considering that the colour convention of the provided JST connector matched the colour convention of the LiPo battery connecting to the Artemis (that is, + terminal connecting to JST connector's red wire, and - terminal of the battery connecting to JST connector's black wire) the connector and the wires feeding into the LiPo battery connect as indicated in the diagram above. The connector from the LiPo battery was removed by separating the wires one at a time, and then cutting them individually. The connection between the LiPo battery and the wires was heat shrunk for a secure connection.</p>
                                <p>Afterwards, SParkFun VL53L1X 4m laser distance sensor library was installed for ToF sensor operation.</p>

                                <h4></h4>
                                <h4>ToF Sensors' Position on the car</h4>
                                <p>My plan for this lab was to position the two ToF sensors at the front and on the side of the car, hence I connected them next to each other relative to the QWIIC connector, as opposed to on the opposite sides of the connector. This seemed like to most optimal choice in my opinion, considering that the car will be able to detect the obstacles in front and to its side. Fo detecting the obstacles on the other side of the car or behind the car, we ought to rotate the car. The two ToF sensor correspond to the longer QWIIC connector cables, due to the fact that they require higher positionality dependence as opposed to the IMU.</p>

                                <p>The <code>XSHUT</code> connection is not necessary for the initial ToF sensor testing. The first test was performed by using Example1_Wire_I2C under the Apollo3 library for scanning the I2C bus in order to verify the address of the sensor. The proposed output is as the following: </p>

                                <h4>Discussion on I2C address</h4>
                                <p>The indicated address is 0x29 which represents 0x52 bit shifted by 1, or <code>0x52 >> 1</code>, thus negecting the last bit. The very last bit is supposed to represent the direction, thus 0 for a write and 1 for a read, hence we are paying attention to the first 7 bits, as can be confirmed from the ToF datasheet.</code></p>

                                <p>The mode that I chose was the Short Distance Mode, as according to the datasheet description, it has the sensor range of 1.3 meters and hence seems like a great fit for the proposed car. Furthermore, it has the best maximum distance under strong ambient light compared to other modes, adequate in this case.</p>

                                <p>This task was performed by utilizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which is an integrated device which converts analog voltage to a digital signal. AnalogRead() function thus enables reading out the temperature data from the sensor. The temperature recorded was about 33400 counts, however, once the chip was held, the temperature would slightly increase. Therefore, the temperature sensor was able to successfully detect the changes. </p>

                                <p>This task taught us how to program a "C" note detector by manipulating on-board LED switching into the Microphone_Output code. The way I implemented the task is by detecting the frequency that is 523 HZ +/- 10 Hz to introduce some error, and in case the freqency detected is in-between the desired range for not "C5", then the LED turns on (blue light) as can be seen in the recorded video. For other frequencies, the LED turns off.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                        <p>This section of the lab focuses on establishing a Bluetooth connection between the Artemis board and the computer. The environments used for this part of the lab were Arduino IDE and Jupyter Lab in order for the bluetooth connection to be established.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h3>Prelab 1B: Installation of Python and Virtual Environment</h3>
                        <p>Before implementing Bluetooth communication, the necessary libraries were installed, including ArduinoBLE (Bluetooth Low Energy, which refers to circumstances of Bluetooth optimization that do not need large data transfers). These libraries allow the Artemis board to act as a BLE peripheral, enabling it to send and receive data wirelessly.</p>
                        <p>The newest version of Python - Python 3.13 - as well as pip were installed. The versions were verified by the commands:</p>
                        <pre><code> python3 --version </code></pre>
                        <p> Afterwards, we may set up the Jupyter Lab environment for the computer interface, which is enabled through the following code snippet:
                        <pre><code> python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble </code></pre>
                        <p> Furthermore, virtual environment ought to be activated in order for Jupyter Notebooks to be used: </p>
                        <pre><code> .\FastRobots_ble\Scripts\activate </code></pre>
                        <p>Another significant aspect of the Prelab 1B was the installation of ArduinoBLE, which thus enabled loading and burning of ble_arduino.ino. My device's MAC address was thus printed out on the Serial Monitor, after which connections.yaml file in Jupyter Lab was edited to reflect the MAC address. </p>

                        <p>Throughout these lab 1B tasks, I had to connect to the Artemis Device in Jupyter Notebook whenever the Bluetooth connection ought to be established. </p>

                        <p>Furtermore, with every case initiation, we update enums in both ble_arduino.ino on the Arduino side, and cmd_types.py on the Jupyter Notebook side.</p>

                        <h4>Task 1: ECHO</h4>
                        <p>The first task aimed to send an echo command that holds a string to the Artemis board, and afterwards receive the augmented version of the string back to the computer, testing the mutual communication.
                            Below are snippets of Arduino IDE code and Jupyter Notebook code, and the Serial Monitor Output, in order.

                        <p> This function stores timestamps in an array of 128, looping through the array and thus sending the entries fast. As opposed to the previous function TIME_LOOP, as in this case we gather the data and then send it in different loops. Arduino IDE code, Jupyter Notebook code and output are in order. Two new global variables of time_data representing an array and data_array are instantiated.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, 128 time stamps were sent ranging from 2496060 ms to 2496064 ms. This method enhances frequency of the time stamps due to the fact that messages do not have to wait for the time stamps in between.</p>

                        <h4>Task 8: Advantages and disadvantages between the methods</h4>
                        <p>From what can be observed, the first method, that is the method of the TIME_LOOP function, cannot send data as fast as SEND_TIME_DATA, due to the fact that it can be observed it has a bigger difference in-between consecutive timestamps. This method can send about 60 messages/s as calculated. Hence, even though it may not be able to send high-resolution data as well, it is the preferred method in the cases where we want the data to be transferred in the exact moment, yet we do not mind for the quality of it as much. This is due to the fact that TIME_LOOP can consistently send the last sample as the most recent sample of the data. </p>

                        <p>On the other hand, the second method utilized by SEND_TIME_DATA as well as GET_TEMP_READINGS is much better at sending high resolution data, and can send thousands of samples/s. However, unlike TIME_LOOP, this methodology cannot be used for most recent, or real-time data sending, as it distributes and collects data into different loops. Furthermore, those arrays and loops instantiated can take up a lot of memory. Considering that Artemis board has 384 kB of RAM, and a float uses 4 bytes of RAM, then we have in total of 96 000 data points available. If we sample 16-bit values at 150 Hz every 5 seconds, we would use 1500 bytes. Hence, 384 kB/1500 bytes would be equal to about 256 5-second intervals of data that are available in the memory.*</p>

                        <h4>Effective Data Rate and Overhead</h4>
                        <p>My idea behind this was to send a message from the computer and then receive a reply from the Artemis. The sent_bytes were incremented in increments of 5 from 0 to 120. The first screenshot represents the Jupyter Notebook code, after which we can see a screenshot representing the packets being sent (from 80 bytes to 120 bytes in this screenshot example) with their data rate displayed, as well as the duration of transmission. Lastly, a graph can be seen, showing the data rate versus the packet size. From the graph, it can be inferred that the curve is almost linear with a few outliers, where with the increase of the bytes sent to the Artemis, we have an increase in the data rate as well as the duration of transmission.</p>
                        <p>Short packets cause overhead because the transmission has a fixed size, and thus with sending 5-byte packets we have a lower effective data rate. On the other hand, larger packets definitely do improve the efficiency because there is a higher effective data rate and the transmission is more efficient as the overhead is spread out more across the actual data.</p>

                    <h4>Reliability</h4>
                    <p>Reliability was tested through sending data at higher rate. Furthermore, I compared the outputs of Arduino IDE Serial Monitor's output with the Jupyter Lab's output to verify the reliability. As can be inferred from the two screenshots, the Jupyter Notebook and the Serial Monitor outputs match completely, hence there is high reliability even when sending higher rate from robot to computer. In extreme cases where data is sent very quickly, there might be a loss in packets as the computer would not be able to process the data quickly. However, that was not detected in this case.</p>
